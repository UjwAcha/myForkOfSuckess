# myForkOfSuckess

Hello

here are all my forks if my suckless utils .
install font awsome 5 , it is a very importaint dependency here .
and get python pywal as well , most linux distributions must have this in their official repos , it manages all fo my colors because i am lazy and unfortunately a very bad artist.


first , put all of the directories in .suckless/ directory , put the scripts in .script/ directory and use the xinitrc , everything will run smoothly. you might have to add autostart patch if you log in to dwm from a display manager because you can't use .xinitrc if you don't log in with startx

thank you for taking a look at my silly fork , i am planning to distrohop so this repo is just for storing my configuration  , have fun ricing your system 



BTW i use arch
